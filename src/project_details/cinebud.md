Cine bud is a project inspired by my love for movies and my work in Pratt & Whitney. I started using Machine Learning for data normalization or classification, and decided to make a project that leverages the OpenAI API for their models to create a movie recommendation system for nights where you want to watch a movie but don’t know what to watch. 

1.) LANDING PAGE
 The landing page is simple, it has a prompt where you type in your mood, or incredibly specific movie vibe like “movies where the aliens are the good guys” or in this case “movies where the good guy wins”.
