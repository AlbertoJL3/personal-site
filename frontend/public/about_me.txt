 I'm a mechanical engineer and curious software developer, passionate about making web applications, designing mechanical systems, and spaceflight technology. I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and learned programming on my own while working my first job. It was at that time that I decided to attend a software bootcamp after work days and code projects on weekends. After 18 months of creating projects and working as a software engineer, I've decided to move to Boston to pursue a career in software, and pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. I'm currently looking for a full-time position that promotes growth and inclusion.
